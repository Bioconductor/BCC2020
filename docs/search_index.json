Most users install and run Bioconductor on a personal computer or perhaps use an academic cluster. Cloud-based solutions are increasing appealing, removing the headaches of local installation while providing access to (a) better, scalable computing resources; and (b) large-scale ‘consortium’ and other reference data sets. This session introduces the AnVIL cloud computing environment. We cover use of the cloud as a replacement to desktop-style computing; integrating workflows for ‘upstream’ processing of large data resources with interactive ‘downstream’ analysis and comprehension, using Human Cell Atlas single-cell datasets as an example; and querying cloud-based consortium data for integration with a users’ own data sets. Prerequisites Participants should be comfortable working with R and RStudio. Some familiarity with Bioconductor is helpful but not required. No prior cloud-based experience is necessary. We will use the AnVIL cloud, which requires a modern web browser.
